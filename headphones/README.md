In this project, I will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. I will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that I learned previously.
I wonâ€™t have a lot of instruction, I am free to implement it the way that I want - the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.The above webpage has been designed by Nicolas Philippot, UI/UX designer.
